# Data-Analytics-Virtual-Experience-Progarm

Supermarkets will regularly change their store layouts, product selections, prices and promotions. This is to satisfy their customer’s changing needs and preferences, keep up with the increasing competition in the market or to capitalise on new opportunities. 

# Code and Resources Used

Python Version: 3.7
Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodel

# Task 1

Examine transaction data – look for inconsistencies, missing data across the data set, outliers, correctly identified category items, numeric data across all tables. If you determine any anomalies make the necessary changes in the dataset and save it. Having clean data will help when it comes to your analysis. 

Examine customer data – check for similar issues in the customer data, look for nulls and when you are happy merge the transaction and customer data together so it’s ready for the analysis ensuring you save your files along the way.

Data analysis and customer segments – in your analysis make sure you define the metrics – look at total sales, drivers of sales, where the highest sales are coming from etc. Explore the data, create charts and graphs as well as noting any interesting trends and/or insights you find. These will all form part of our report to Julia. 

Deep dive into customer segments – define your recommendation from your insights, determine which segments we should be targeting, if packet sizes are relative and form an overall conclusion based on your analysis. 

# Task 2

Select control stores – explore the data and define metrics for your control store selection – think about what would make them a control store. Look at the drivers and make sure you visualise these in a graph to better determine if they are suited. For this piece it may even be worth creating a function to help you. 

Assessment of the trial – this one should give you some interesting insights into each of the stores, check each trial store individually in comparison with the control store to get a clear view of its overall performance. We want to know if the trial stores were successful or not. 

Collate findings – summarise your findings for each store and provide an recommendation that we can share with Julia outlining the impact on sales during the trial period

# Task 3

Report on insights and recommendations that can be used when developing the strategic plan for the next half year.
